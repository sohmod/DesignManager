  <h1>High-resolution or low-resolution?</h1>
  If you don't want to read all this, and are doing normal-ish things,
  just select <b>Beats me. You decide.</b> That will use high-resolution
  for the Google Earth button and low-resolution for the Google Maps button.
  <p>
  Google Earth is able to handle many many more points than Google Maps is.
  If you want to display this KML on Google Earth, and that is all you will
  ever do with it, you want <b>High resolution</b>.
  <p>
  If you are going to display a map using Google Maps, you probably want
  <b>Low resolution</b>.  You can try the
  high-resolution version, but you'd better be prepared for a wait.  If
  your computer is wimpy enough, it might not display at all.  You
  might also get a notice along the lines of "Some script here is taking an 
  <i>awfully</i> long time, are you <i>sure</i> you want to keep running it?"
  The lower-resolution version will convey the same information and be
  a lot faster.
  <p>
  If you are downloading a KML file that somebody will later incorporate into
  Google Maps (for example, using the Google API yourself), then you probably want
  to use <b>Low resolution</b>.
