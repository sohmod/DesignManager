<h1>Why should you give the year?</h1>

    Giving a the year that the data is for is useful in part because you will be able to check your
    files in the future against my documentation to see if you can get better accuracy.  
    <p>
    For example,
    maybe you have data from 1995 for the amount of floss used per state, and you want to 
    divide it by my population to get per-capita figures. 
    Right now, my population numbers are for 2006, so it's close, but not perfect.
    However, maybe next month I'll add population figures for the past 
    forty years.  You might want to regenerate the KML file -- but
    you don't remember what year your data was from.  
    <p>
    No problem!  Just look inside the file to see what you put down when you generated the file the first time.
    <p>
    It's also a nice courtesy to the people who will see your data later.  They
    might like to know where the data came from.
